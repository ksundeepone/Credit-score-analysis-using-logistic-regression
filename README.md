A step-by-step description of each part:

1. **Importing Libraries & Functions:**
   - Importing necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, and functions/modules from scikit-learn for data manipulation, modeling, and evaluation.

2. **Importing Dataset:**
   - Mounting Google Drive to access files.
   - Reading an Excel file containing the dataset using pandas.

3. **Data Preparation:**
   - Checking the shape of the dataset (number of rows and columns).
   - Displaying the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.
   - Dropping the 'ID' column as it seems unnecessary for modeling.
   - Checking for missing values in the dataset.
   - Filling missing values with the mean of respective columns.
   - Checking missing values again to ensure no missing values remain.
   - There are some commented-out lines possibly showing analysis like value counts and data summary.

4. **Train Test Split:**
   - Separating the target variable (y) and feature variables (X) from the dataset.
   - Splitting the dataset into training and test sets (80:20 ratio) using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn.
   - Standardizing the feature variables using `StandardScaler` to scale them to have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1.
   - Exporting the normalization coefficients (scaler) for later use.

5. **Risk Model Building:**
   - Initializing a logistic regression classifier.
   - Fitting the classifier on the training data.
   - Making predictions on the test data.

6. **Model Performance:**
   - Printing the confusion matrix and accuracy score of the model to evaluate its performance.

7. **Writing Output File:**
   - Generating predicted probabilities for each class (0 and 1) using `predict_proba`.
   - Constructing a DataFrame containing the actual outcomes, predicted probabilities, and predicted target labels.
   - Writing this DataFrame to an Excel file for further analysis.
